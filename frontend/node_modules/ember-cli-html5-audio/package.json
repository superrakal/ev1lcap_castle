It is just as easy as adding audio tags to\nyour template.hbs file, but this was created for a page with many audio elements, \nso this was cleaner.\n\nOne interesting issue the author had was that the audio tag would not work with\na nested `<source>` tag, therefor this was used: \n`<audio controls preload=\"none\" {{bind-attr src=src}}></audio>`\n\n## Installation\n\n* npm install ember-cli-html5-audio\n\n## Usage\n\nIn a template file, you can do something like \n`{{html5-audio-basic url=track.url}}` \nwhere track.url points to a song url.\n\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).\n",
